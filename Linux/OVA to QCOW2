To convert an OVA file to QCOW2 format, you'll need to first extract the VMDK from the OVA file (since OVA is essentially a tarball), then convert it to QCOW2. Here are the steps:

1. First, extract the OVA file:
```bash
tar -xvf your_file.ova
```

2. This will extract the VMDK file. Then convert the VMDK to QCOW2:
```bash
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 your_extracted_file.vmdk output_file.qcow2
```

Replace "your_file.ova" with your actual OVA filename, "your_extracted_file.vmdk" with the extracted VMDK filename, and "output_file.qcow2" with your desired output filename.

If you need to check the format of your source file:
```bash
qemu-img info your_file
```

If you run into any permissions issues, you might need to use `sudo`:
```bash
sudo qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 your_extracted_file.vmdk output_file.qcow2
```
